## A value-based deep reinforcement learning model with human expertise in optimal treatment of sepsis 
# ID3QNE-algorithm
Architecture of ID3QNE algorithm. The real-time treatment process of the ID3QNE agent. Patients' vital signs and drug level are monitored and recorded in real time. Then construct continuous state space and discrete action space. The agent makes decisions based on states, actions, and clinicianâ€™s experience. Finally, patients are treated dynamically.
